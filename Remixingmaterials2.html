        <h1 class="title">Remixing Materials</h1>
        <p>I cannot not mention in these two reflections, that life changed a bit. Under the word of life, I’m thinking of sensing time, being physically somewhere or just how I can focus.

<p>This week we had a class with Laura Freixas, the second part of our Remixing Materials course, the part where we contextualise the knowledge we acquired and the materials we collect. By this time I can confidentially say that I can actually acquire knowledge from a physical class by being there online. With these weeks when some bad energies are chasing me and making it impossible from me to attend at classes I studied a lot about myself and about the topics we are studying about, spending all the time by-myself and by my studies. Lauras presentation was very eye opening how they built and found a very diverse community around a very emergent topic, the usage of waste and the rethinking of our ecosystems of materials. Talking about communities I mean all the stakeholders they are involving in their practice, such as educating kids and schools, collaborating with many collectives and university students, and collaborating with business who can rethink their own eco-systems by studying from Laura’s practice.</p>

<p>First we had a task to think about wastes you can collect around the neighbourhood of Poblenou and  ways of contextualising it. We live on the border of Poblenou, but we couldn't reach it, so we had to think about waste we generate in our own households and contextualise it in our very own context. Our main interests are (due to the starting limitation we have)  recycled materials - firstly plastic and Hybrid living materials - firstly bacterial cellulose, all of them from household waste. </p>

<p>We both have a strong belief. We believe that the first and most important before step in a material cycle is that we would design new materials, to use by the already existing ones discarded. If not that we see a great potential in additive design, but under the sake of its natural
way, therefore instead of us creating we will provide a platform to nature to create.</p>

<p>So with the aim of being able and do the first steps in our research, we started experimenting with household waste for making strong ad resilient materials from them. Later on we want to use the precious plastic machines to process our other wastes we collected, which is plastic and start experimenting with growing materials from household waste, for that we would like tor start building an incubator in the near future.</p>

<p>After the class we got a gorgeous package of every equipment we needed  fo making Bio materials at home. So this week when I will be able and come out of my room with a negative test to not infect my other IAAC roommates, we will experiment on home wast in the context of: using already existing materials for a rounded lifecycle and to create new kind of “hybrid-living, self-growing” materials in the means of bacterial cellulose.</p>
