                      <p>Through the <a href="https://fablabbcn-projects.gitlab.io/learning/fabacademy-local-docs/challenge/c_2/" target="_blank" class="link-kek">second Fab academy challenge</a> I worked with <a href="https://anna-mestres.github.io/anna.mestres/" target="_blank" class="link-kek">Anna</a> again, last time we co-created for co-creation and for giving voice between the youngest generations. But this time we worked for co-creation and giving voice to our research topics for our community on Design Dialogues.</p>

<p>Since both of us is dealing with future generations and different decision making methods in the present for them. Our purpose and solution critical interaction to create conversations at the Design Dialogues, which will make our guests think about how their decisions and actions change something in the future they don't see at the moment and lead them to our individual research questions - about decisions in the present for future generations.</p>

<p>Check out our <a href="https://github.com/Anna-Mestres/fab_challenge_II" target="_blank" class="link-kek">repository</a> for the whole project!</p>

<p>The analogy for this approach was the trinity of the butterfly effect, the superposition and the consequences in our lives. To embody this analogy we created a controller box with a question: ‘Do you see the consequences of your decisions?’ with random trigger buttons , which seemingly doesen’t ract to your actions immediately, a path which asks you ‘what?’ and ‘About what?’ and another box connected to the first one with 4 metres of cables which reacts randomly and delayed to your actions with different auras of colours, connected to different decision makings - topics in our research.</p>

<p>Through designing a critical design for responsible thinking, we had many actions as well which required responsibility. First we created our project plan and our triage, we spent a lots of time on it, which helped us through the 4 days. As a reflection working on a challenge just the 2 of us, was not easy, but I think our decisions, such us implementing a really complex thought into a really easy design system made it easier. After the weekend when we decided our plan for this challenge,  we shared our responsibilities quiet well: Anna Mestres was responsible for the flow chart of the interactions, electronics, coding, uploading our repository and helping me with the structure of design and ideations. My responsibility was to do a quick design research on the theory connected to our ideas and create a kind of philosophical system to it. I was also responsible for the forms which follows Anna’s functions, for the CNC cutting and 3d printing files and for the graphics both for the device and for the repository.</p>

<p>I found this challenge as a very good learning opportunity. It consisted of already acquired learnings and more complex tasks which aimed for new and very quick learnings, as well as quick iteration processes. Almost every step was really challenging in connection the scale of our group, but I think our commitment for empathy and rapid decisions let us to not even focus on these, but to enjoy the whole process. I am very aware of the fact that I am still not even close to be comfortable with coding an electronics, maybe this challenge could be an opportunity for that, but because there were many other tasks in it, which I am very comfortable with, I had to take them for the end result, for actually creating our plan for Design Dialogues. It was an efficient week for production, for learning about workflows and maybe next time will be a great time to allow myself closer to the unknown.</p>
