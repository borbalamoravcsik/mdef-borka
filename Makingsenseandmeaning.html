                        <h1 class="title">Course introduction</h1>
                        <p>Through this course which consists of 4 classes we will reflect on ourselves as designers, thinkers or agents of change and make sense of all the questions we are addressing as professionals or just as individuals. Every decision we make is designing a small part of the engine we are collectively building with our societies. As designers we placed our selves in a role when we are consciously calling these decisions as design steps or means of design in many areas of our lives.  We try to create dialogues for change of for more conscious continuity and for that this course will show us, how previous generations and movements built up this path, how they thought about these societal questions and how they are addressing or addressed them. So on our first introductory course we started having discussions about many models, such as the Bauhaus modell, the Ulm modell or the Krebs cycle. When talking about these, a need for getting to know more Eastern schools and models came up, so hoping we will continue of studying those too. My hope is really strong for this, because I “grew up” as a design student under the protecting and inspiring wing of the Bauhaus school. My design university got it’s name from Moholy-Nagy László, who was a very important representative and also a professor at the Bauhaus school. How he said in his essay on Typophoto: “Every period has it’s own focus”… through this class we will explore what should be our main focus as designers, solving emergent challenges in the present, for the future.

                          <p>This week is a bit slower to me, one of today’s biggest and most invisible problem just reached me, I was tested positive and somehow instead of being a bit better every day, this virus works the opposite way. So I had to really focus on this class when we talked about how can we more aware of the invisible word that is surrounding us… Stephanie Hankey is of the researchers and designers who tries to show it to us and to younger generations. In her international NGO - Tactical tech they are fighting for a world where digital technologies can contribute to a more equitable, democratic and sustainable society. To enable this change, they investigate how digital technologies impact society and individual autonomy. She talked about many of her eyeopening projects, such as the Glassroom - an interactive exhibition that is generating a global conversation about data and privacy and their Exposing the invisible kit. She talked about very interesting ways of engaging citizens and their target group. How they are aiming to actually create dialogues between the one who create technology and their youngest users, which is maybe one of the hardest part of their practice, to engage in a way, where they make sure all the aspects of their research is ethical and leading for the impact they want to create. This creates new questions in my continuity of my research. Since as a design researcher I delt with ethical research and ethical design addressing our own projects, mostly the ones which were “charity” ones, but how can I rethink this whole system based ion the age of the participants in my research?
