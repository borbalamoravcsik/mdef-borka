						<h1 class="title">My 2nd and 3rd design review</h1>
						<p>On the second and third design review we were in groups, in the groups we did our first design intervention with. So here I want to reflect on these two:</p>
            <ul class="listaelem"><li>The first one which lead us to what can really help to understand our challenge</li>
              <li>The second one which helped us to do further steps about the finalised intervention to our design dialogue</li></ul>

              <p>Our first group design review was with Kate and we also talked a lot with Dafni about the questions we deal with and what can be the doubts of our project. By this time we explored our topic in our design space, through mapping our local ecosystem, community engagement thanks to Merkel and Marcé and through many many brainstorming and research sessions.</br>

                <img src="assets/images/portfolio/2nd_brainstorm.png" alt="">
              </div>

              <div class="portfolio-details-image col-lg-4 col-4 mb-sm-30 mb-xs-30">
                          <img src="assets/images/portfolio/2nd_designspace.png" alt="">
                        </div>

              <div class="portfolio-details-image col-lg-4 col-4 mb-sm-30 mb-xs-30">
                                    <img src="assets/images/portfolio/2nd_community.png" alt=""></br>
                        </div>

              <p>But after all this, after we agreed that our challenge will be this:</br>
              <p>We studied in systems created by the needs of previous generations and led by them. Today's needs changed and the hierarchy in teaching and learning should change as well.</br>
                How can we change what we learn and how we learn it?</br>
                How can we create new ways of learning, by raising our voice and showing our needs?</br>
                Also how can we be aware of those needs?</br>
                But after all this, after we agreed that our challenge will be this:</br>


              <ul class="listaelem"><li>empowering the agency of children through the lenses of urbanism, as co-creators</li>
  							<li>emotions are related to learning experience</li>
                <li>decentralised learning</li>
                <li>learning from other minority group experiences</li>
                <li>triggers that allow you to make decision</li></ul>

    						<p>After being our review with Kate, we gained in many things as a group. We learnt from her that, maybe we can stick to these and after we individually explored we can frame it as a group. We studies that during our intervention we have to be really careful about the fact that we have to develop the oppositeness of learning and education systems. We learnt about mapping techniques and most importantly to always remember, when doing an intervention: Set the boundaries, set the “playground”, the parameters on this playground (what, why, where, how) again and again!</p>

                <p>After this review we came up of our intervention, that you can see here: <a href="https://borbalamoravcsik.github.io/mdef-borka/portfolio-details_12.html" target="_blank" class="link-kek"> Aprendizaje Emocionante:</a>
                  Where we invited people from everywhere to join us and draw the map of their learning journeys:</p>

                <p>In the meantime, when we were doing our intervention and explore the learning paths, we had the opportunity to have a design review before Design Dialogues with Mariana, where she helped us how can we plan our future together as a group, how can we set goals for design dialogues and what can we use our intervention technique for in the future.</p>

                <p>And after these reviews which helped us grow as a group, as individual students and thinkers in our challenges and last but not least made our first design intervention happen, the Design Dialogues came, <a href="https://borbalamoravcsik.github.io/mdef-borka/Design-dialogues.html" target="_blank" class="link-kek"> here you can see what happened there.</a></p>

                <p>Hope to see you there in the next therms!</p>
