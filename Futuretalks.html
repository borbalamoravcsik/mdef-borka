                        <p>On our first Future Talks session we met Audrey. She is an assistant professor in interaction design at University of Washington, in the Audrey who is an Interaction Design Researcher and Educator who does research at her own design research studio at Tilt.</p>

<p>Her aim is to rethink the world of the Internet of things, through participatory design, autobiographical approaches  and research-through-design. She mainly talked about these tools and methods to first person practices of her. We also touched the surface of ethical and non biased data collection of 1PP approaches.</p>

<p>She showed us examples through 2 of her projects. The first one was how can you build a community around you by a 1PP project, it was her <a href="http://www.audreydesjardins.com/research/livingprototype.html#" target="_blank" class="link-kek">thesis project, living in a prototype</a> when she built a van by herself and documented all her steps through this journey. The second example was about analogue data collecting techniques. She talked about her data collector collection, which aims to raise awareness about every day data our environment collects. One of the object was the Soft Fading, which is an analog device that  collects sunlight data on a cylinder of revolving turmeric dyed fabric.</p>

<p>My takeaways from her talk: how important is is to engage with yourself about a research topic before engaging with others, continuously document for continuous reflections, collaboration is a must even in 1PP, reiterate and design from mistakes</p>

                          <p>On our second Future Talks session we met with Laura Forlano who is a design researcher, an Associate Professor of Design at the Institute of Design at Illinois Institute of Technology, where she is also Director of the Critical Futures Lab. I was really curious about her talk since I’m followed her work through the book of From Social Butterfly to Engaged Citizen.</p>

<p>She also talked about a 1PP research or her, through calling herself as a 'disabled cyborg’. She introduced us to the world of T1 diabetics and to an every day life with a pump, which is regulating her insulin levels, she is bound to a piece of technology she cannot actively design or debug. Due to her state of health, she has to transform her body and contribute in the socio-technical practices that constitute hacking and (un)hacking.</p>

<p>This topic was eye opening for me from the perspective of a world, where we all start to wear different wearables and attachments as innovations and think about the ethical and human aspects of it. But how is it, when you have no choice, you are fighting to be human by wearing them and when you can only live a fully ethical and humanised life with them.

<p>My takeaways from her talk: How important it is to always try to rethink and hack our own systems for a more clear vision about our own life.</p>
