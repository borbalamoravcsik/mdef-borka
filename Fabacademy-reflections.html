                        <p>What?</br> 
                        The first week was about many gits and pushes... All the basics that provides us the background for a greatly documented and proccessed Fab Academy adventure. 
                        In this first week we were intoduced to the structure of the course and how will we collaborete in this course locally and globally, in small groups and as a collective of member os the Fablab Barcelona.</p>

                        <p>Why?</br> 
                        To be able and move around a bit more comfortable around the digital world of gits, as a start of our knowledge about coding and the phisical knowledge, in the challenging year of <a href="https://fabacademy.org#" target="_blank" class="link-kek">Fab Academy trimester</a></li> </p>

                        <p>How?</br> 
                        Through local and global presentations from our team of Fablab Barcelona and from Neil Gershenfeld - professor at MIT and the director of MIT's Center for Bits and Atoms, a sister lab to the MIT Media Lab.</p> 

                        <p>Next steps...
                          <ul class="listaelem">
                          <li>Studying more about Webflow and Fork, for an easier way of writing these reflections</li>
                          <li>Get a bit more comfortable with the idea of my own triage in my tasks through this semester...</li></ul>

                          <h1 class="title">W2 - Computer-aided design</h1>
                          <p>This week we started scratching the surface of the digital design world, where we talked about different formats and textures a computer aided software can create. We had a theoretical class, where we dived deep into the world of rasters, vectors, resolutions for different purposes of the 2D design. For me these were familiar concepts, but I always like to look behind these again and again to freshen up the knowledge about these “buzz words” we are using every day. </p>
                          <p>After 2D we made a huge rotate on the axes and started studying about 3D design, the theory behind Nurbs and Mashes and challenges about parametric design. Under the word challenges I mostly think about tools and programs for different aims with our 3D design. Mostly I’m using Rhino and I studied a bit of Solid-works - two very different workflow and working method, but now I want to dig deeper in Fusion360 and Grasshopper, to be able and create parametric designs in an easier way and understand it more.</p>
                          <p>Talking about tools and methods, Victor showed us a very different way of using and creating the tools which we are designing. He talked about how Blender was born and about the evolving community who keeps it alive. The concept of the existence of Blender is very interesting to me and next to experiment with the tool, I’m looking forward to understand the creator community behind it.</p>

                          <h3 class="title">The assignment</h3>
                          <p>This week’s assignment was to do a 3D design which is connected somehow to our research project and then combine it with 2D parts:</p>
                          <p>So I designed some parts of an open source toy system in Rhino, rendered them in Keyshot and showed the system of it in a 2D design by Photoshop and Illustrator.</p>
                          <p>With my research project I’m focusing on the accelerating urbanisation and on it’s really important aspect - the urban childhood. Today it is really important to use our cities and our spaces for dialogues for a tomorrow, which includes answers to all of our needs.</p>
                          <p>For that we have to provide information and platform for knowledge to give agency for all the generations to know that they have a voice and it is important for all of us to shape our environment together - the awareness of decision making.
                            So I want to use the system of our cities and neighbourhoods, to co-design with kids, learning about the importance of their own rights, such as: freedom of speech and the ability os making decisions. And by doing so create dialogues between stakeholders, such as decision makers, urbanists and child-right activists for common planning and thinking by the means of our own public spaces. To be able and use the public spaces for actually lining together.
                            For this intervention, I want to think in an open-source and distributed way, to be able and provide this approach easily in many schools, neighbourhoods and networks. So for this task I designed an open-source and by that a scalable part of an “educational” toy system which invites different generations for co-designing in their class rooms first and then in their own neighbourhood’s public spaces.</p>
                          <p>Emphasising the aspect of inclusivity in design and play-fullness in cities:</br>
                            Creating space to play! Creating space for inclusivity and safe!</p>

                            <h1 class="title">W3 - Computer-controlled cutting</h1>
                            <p>This week we studied about the implementation of the 2D design into 3D, by the means of phisycal forms and shapes. How to turn digital blueprints into objects from the same vector file.</p>

<p>First time I’ve ever used a laser cutter was 5 years before in Fablab Budapest, when we created a huge fractal statute from paper. That time the aid of parametrical design and the realisation of the pieces was unattainable.</p>

<p>I was really excited to start using these machines in Fablab Barcelona as well, and to be able and start ideating about oper source projects it can be a helpful tool for. I used the laser cutter for my task and was also considering the vinyl cutter for symbols, but I figured just for aesthetics I dont want to turn on a machine and create either a little amount of waste from vinyl.</p>

<p>So for our weekly assignment I used the analogy of a bauhaus project, when from architectural blueprints, graphic designers designed movements and connected the movements to the three basic shapes of the bauhaus and from them contemporary
dancers created coreographies.</p>

<p>I used this graphics and movements for phisycal embodiments, created a building game which is based on them. I used parametric design for scaling and slicing the shapes to halfs for an interresting sturcture. The base of the building game is the MDF sheet which its cut from - the wholes of the press fit parts.
</p>

<p>Below you can see the design:</p>

                              <p>This week we studied about electronics, but a bit deeper than usually. We dived deep into the electronical devices we have and analyzed the circuit boards and their creations. The history of it and how they are made is super interresting and I was happy to refresh and deepen the menories and the knowledge about it, after the precourse we had with the fablab team.</p>

<p>So next to the theoretical knowledge we acquired, we also started making these with LED lights. We followed the preparation of the board and then on little precut pieces we dwelled circuits and the connection of the LED.</p>

                                <p>This week week we studied about 3D and scanning techniques.
These are techniques I am really interested for a long time by now and also had many opportunities  to try them in many forms. However this lab showed such new things I would love to experiment with later on.</p>

<p>We studied about the theory, such as the history of 3d methods, evolution and principles of these additive manufacturing methods. About technologies, such as: vat photopolymerization, material extrusion, material jetting and blinder jetting, such as the materials we can use for these technologies.</p>
</div>

<p>The most interesting part was the material extrusion, when with the whole class we could try a so-called food printer, made by an MDEF alumni with the FabLab team for a thesis project.</p>

                            </div>

<p>Later on we also experimented with 3d scanning - the point cloud based and about photogametry. I found it really interesting, how we can use some programs which generates mashes from the point cloud. </p>

<p>As an addition, the next week we studied about real time 3d design through Grashopper in Rhino, this method I aiming to use in one of my intervention connected to inclusive and equitable design in our urban spaces, with groups of neighbours around Poblenou.</p>

<p>Here you can see my assignment, which I will try to 3D print from a more flexible material and from clay as well, and experinemnt with its impelentation in the real environment.</p>

<p> I became really interrested in the topic, so until Design Dialogues, connected to our design intervention with Angel about biodiversity in urban environment, I will continue my experimentation with these kind of 'urban hacking' designs.</p>

                                  <p>This week we continued our studies and built more skills in the topics of electronics. We studied about KiCad which was developed in CERN, to draw PCB schematics, create a layout factoring in the footprint of each component, and exporting it to be milled. Cern inventions are really closed to my heart since my Grandpa was a scientist there and as a child I followed with admiration everything he talked about.</p>

<p>Although, maybe the world of electronics is the  farthest from me, we are planning to design our next micro challenge project based on these for a further intervention, connected to data collection.</p>
<p>Assignment coming soon...</p>

                                    <h1 class="title">W7 - Computer-Controlled Machining</h1>
                                    <p>The time has come and we studied about computer controlled machine processes, about the power of subtractive manufacturing technology.</p>

<p>We studied about the parts of the machine, how to design for machining - about fillets and nesting (the last one I’m really interested in, I really believe it has its own art and takes up a very important part from the point se design the object). We studied about joineries as well, which I want to get deeper knowledge in, so in the next few days I will study the joinery library for more options in my designs. We also studied about G-code and how the machine should be set up with different materials we can use with it.</p>

<p>Personally using CNC machine for our designs is a really efficient way of not generating too much waste and enabling ourselves and others (with distributed, open source designs) to many times do it tool free and very easy to replicate.</p>
