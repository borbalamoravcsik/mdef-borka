						<h1 class="title">Design Studio 02 - 2nd class</h1>
            <h1 class="title">A 1PP Design intervention in context. Look for your peers and communities</h1>

            <p><b>Reflection, objective:</b></p>
<p>This week, starting with our Design  Studio our aim was to understand ourselves better as a design tool in contexts and to learn how to properly document, analyze and make sense of our design action from a 1PP.  Before this class we had two very eye opening talks for our better futures as designers to help us in these activities, one from Audrey Desjardines about Autobiographical Design and one from Laura Forlano about Auto-ethnography. </p>
<p>On the class we went deeper in the methods how can we document our 1pp design actions for more insightful questions and challenges for our alternative presents.</p>
<p>Later on we proposed our first intervention plan and looked for other classmates who can collaborate on them, who share similar interests or approaches for the long-term research. This was very interesting to see how everyone’s question evolved since we last presented these. Furthermore the most interesting part was to make connections between us, to come up with common path ways sometimes connected to really different approaches.</p>
<p>We all had a maximum 3 minute pitch about our intervention plan, you might already read it in my previous reflection, but if you didn’t, here you can see it.</p>

<p><b>Task and deliverable:</b></p>
<p>In my plan I included many different disciplines and individuals to see their reality and through that see my research questions with them and by them. Despite all of my plans, it became more 1pp than I thought. It was only me in my room, engaging a community in the online space. I got covid and was very sick, so my intervention plan changed and created discussions about the built environment online.</p>
<p>My goal was to:
<ul class="listaelem"><li>Experience 1pp what the built / online environment means to us and experience other’s experiences through conversations.</li>
<li>See how people think about the concept of the effect and how can they express it.</li>
<li>To be able to form further questions for the next interventions</li></ul>

<p>Thus:</p>
<p>I captured memories about we what see in our spaces on a daily basis, by observing real time feelings about these spaces and by probing the my / one's presence in it's own environment and by probing the my / one's presence in it's own environment.</p>
<p>Based on the research questions, such as:</p>
<ul class="listaelem"><li>How does the built environment have an affect on me / us? - Do I / we recognise it?</li>
<li>Do I / we feel we have an affect on it?</li>
<li>How conscious am I /are we about the built environment, that surrounds us?</li>
<li>How my / our mood changes the spaces and how we experience them…</li></ul>
<p>I found answers to these with a little exercise, I asked 11 people, from 3 countries in 2 different languages, to:</p>

                                    </div>

<p>On this Miro board you can see the documentation and the findings of my intervention, an intervention which offered findings and insights and through them an alternative present about how we interact with the built environment in theory and physically:</p>

<ul class="listaelem"><li>Familiar spaces don't hide anything new - but is it good enough or are we just used to it?</li>
<li>We connect spaces with the actions we do there  - these actions are mostly not related to the space, but to our goals.</li>
<li> We have many embodied experiences, feelings connected to the built environment - literally talking about our body.</li>
<li>The sounds are the ones which creates the space around us.</li>
<li>Our spaces give small insights to us  which we can use as inspiration,  things to think about, by just focusing on them, them which built by other minds like ours, inspired by other environments.</li></ul>
By these findings I developed my next research and intervention steps:
<ul class="listaelem"><li>How can we create platforms together where we have dialogues aboUt these? - make a connection on our aligned challenges to fight together with AQUI</li>
<li>I want to continue challenge places and people on what are they designed for and what are the actual needs?</li></ul>
